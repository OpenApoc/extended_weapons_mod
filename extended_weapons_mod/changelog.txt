[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] Civilian Organisation relations to X-COM increased from 0 to 50 (Hopefully this will help stop civilian hostile if X-COM doesn't kill civilians in blasts)
[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] X-COM Organisation relations to Civilian increased from 0 to 100 (Hopefully this will help stop civilian hostile if X-COM doesn't kill civilians in blasts)

[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] Security Station Turrets in Original Game shoot PLASMA, the EWM now ensures that all standard base defences use plasma damage, sprites, and sounds for shooting
[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] Advanced Security Station Turrets in Original Game shoot DISRUPTOR, the EWM now ensures that all advanced base defences use DISRUPTOR damage, sprites, and sounds for shooting

[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] DAMAGETYPE_LASER_BEAM made <non_violent>true</non_violent> to allow it to not blow up poppers - NOTE - Plasma should have this too as per OG, but that makes no sense; a burning ball of energy is not "none-violent" so not adding to plasma weapons for now

[Change]	The whole EWM has had it's file names checked to ensure that EVERYTHING is in lowercase and, where possible, without spaces. This aids compatibility with none-windows operating systems.
[Change]	In accordance with the above, the EWM mod folder is now extended_weapons_mod

[Change]	Several EWM Weapons, including, Gauss, Plasma and laser ones have had their object and equip sprite name changed to aid bug whacking

[Change]	Difficulty Files changed to submod folder and LUA script added. Files renamed 0-4 instead of 1-5 to conform to JonnyH's changes to base mod.

[Change]	UFO_GROWTH_LIMIT is doubled for all UFOs. This doubles the maximum number of UFOs of each type you can face (providing they grow them fast enough)

[Change]	Weekly number of UFOs grown by the aliens is doubled, except for UFO_GROWTH_DEFAULT which has different values to keep the aliens alive longer; expect more incursions, even when you are destroying the alien dimension! The end game is no longer easy and X-COM will have to fight in two places as well as avoid UFOs when navigating the alien dimension instead of attempting to butcher them...

[Change]	Agent Equipment Code re-ordered and restructured into a more alphabetised form with clips beneath the related weapon

[Change]	Human Tech Levels altered drastically to allow for more human enemy damage from a variety of new and old weapons. Expect to see nearly all of the EWM weapons in use at least once in the list, if only for one tech level.

[Change]	Average number of guards doubled for all organisations except Aliens, X-COM and Civilian.

[Change] Marsec F1000 Flame-Thrower IN Tank Bullet TTL (Time to Live) Decreased from 2700 to 320 ( Fire falls to the ground at approximately 13 tiles. This means that the range allows the target to be identified and flame dropped a tile or two IN FRONT of it)
