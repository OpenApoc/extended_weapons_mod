***THIS RELEASE***
******************

==V9.0J (INTERNAL)==

[Change]		Conversion of forceweb.png to 8-bit Indexed Colour to 8-bit RGB Colour to see if this resolves a UFOPaedia Crash with the image
[Change]		Conversion of megapol_lawpistol_smart_clip_1.png to 8-bit RGB Colour and visual update to match pequip sprite more closely
[Change]		Conversion of megapol_lawpistol_stun_clip_1.png to 8-bit RGB Colour and visual update to match pequip sprite more closely
[Change]		Conversion of minilauncher_smart_missile_1.png to 8-bit RGB Colour and visual update to match pequip sprite more closely
[Change]		Conversion of minilauncher_stun_missile_1.png to 8-bit RGB Colour and visual update to match pequip sprite more closely
[Change]		Addition of "missing" tags for the ForceWeb under agent_equipment.xml based on the Stun Grapple entry with placeholder stats to try and stop the weapon crashing the game
[Change]		MAY CRASH THE GAME added to the Research Entry for the ForceWeb until we work out why it crashes - there is no obvious reason at present
[Change]		<explosionDoodad> for DAMAGETYPE_PSIONIC_BLAST changed to DOODAD_23_PSIONIC_GAS from DOODAD_18_SMOKE in damage_types.xml
[Change]		<explosion_depletion_rate> for AEQUIPMENTTYPE_PSI-GRENADE changed from 10 to 12 to make the smoke from the blast clear quicker in agent_equipment.xml
[Change]		DAMAGEMODIFIER_ANDROID changed from 0 to 10 for DAMAGETYPE_PSIONIC_BLAST to stop represent the blast affecting Android components (EMP-Like Effect) in damage_types.xml
[Change]		A single VEHICLETYPE_ALIEN_BOMBER_DUMB added to week 1 of the ufo_growth_lists.xml to allow the aliens to spawn a bombing mission on week 1 as represented in the starting video - It cannot be accessed for a ground mission when it crashes to avoid the player getting research early and will be recovered just as the Alien Probe and Alien Scout offering the same research.
[Change]		A single VEHICLETYPE_ALIEN_BOMBER_DUMB added to week 2 of the ufo_growth_lists.xml
[Change]		UFO_INCURSION_A11 added to the ufo_incursions.xml to support the introduction of VEHICLETYPE_ALIEN_BOMBER_DUMB at Week 1
[Change]		Week 1, Week 2 and Week 3 UFO Mission Prefences changed to include a 20% chance of an Attack Mission instead of it being 100% Infiltration Missions under ufo_mission_preference.xml
[Change]		VEHICLETYPE_ALIEN_BOMBER_DUMB added with a limit of 3 to UFO Growth Limit list in ufo_growth_lists.xml
[Change]		Most entries in ufopaedia.xml changed to refer to their corresponding PNG background image under data/ufopaedi of the mod
[Add]			Most new items in ufopaedi.xml now have new PNG backgrounds under data/ufopaedi or, at the very least, placeholder PNG files
[Add]			VEHICLETYPE_ALIEN_BOMBER_DUMB added to vehicle_types.xml to function as a version of the Alien Bomber UFO that does not give anything but research matching the Alien Scout and Alien Probe UFO types. It does NOT generate a ground mission for recovery either.
[Add]			AEQUIPMENTTYPE_ALIEN_PSI-GRENADE added to agent_equipment.xml, economy.xml and both research.xml ( RESEARCH_ALIEN_PSI_GRENADE ) and ufopaedia.xml ( PAEDIAENTRY_ALIEN_PSI_GRENADE )ready for inclusion at a later point under the working name of "Psi-Gas Pod"
[Add]			alien_psi_grenade_v1.png added to data/ufopaedi for later use
[Add]			AEQUIPMENTTYPE_AUTO_CANNON_ALIEN_GAS_CLIP for the AutoCannon to agent_equipment.xml

[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] Civilian Organisation relations to X-COM increased from 0 to 50 (Hopefully this will help stop civilian hostile if X-COM doesn't kill civilians in blasts)
[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] X-COM Organisation relations to Civilian increased from 0 to 100 (Hopefully this will help stop civilian hostile if X-COM doesn't kill civilians in blasts)

[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] Security Station Turrets in Original Game shoot PLASMA, the EWM now ensures that all standard base defences use plasma damage, sprites, and sounds for shooting
[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] Advanced Security Station Turrets in Original Game shoot DISRUPTOR, the EWM now ensures that all advanced base defences use DISRUPTOR damage, sprites, and sounds for shooting

[Fix]		[Test for OpenApoc trunk] DAMAGETYPE_LASER_BEAM made <non_violent>true</non_violent> to allow it to not blow up poppers - NOTE - Plasma should have this too as per OG, but that makes no sense; a burning ball of energy is not "none-violent" so not adding to plasma weapons for now

[Change]	The whole EWM has had it's file names checked to ensure that EVERYTHING is in lowercase and, where possible, without spaces. This aids compatibility with none-windows operating systems.
[Change]	In accordance with the above, the EWM mod folder is now extended_weapons_mod

[Change]	Several EWM Weapons, including, Gauss, Plasma and laser ones have had their object and equip sprite name changed to aid bug whacking

[Change]	Difficulty Files changed to submod folder and LUA script added. Files renamed 0-4 instead of 1-5 to conform to JonnyH's changes to base mod.

[Change]	UFO_GROWTH_LIMIT is doubled for all UFOs. This doubles the maximum number of UFOs of each type you can face (providing they grow them fast enough)

[Change]	Weekly number of UFOs grown by the aliens is doubled, except for UFO_GROWTH_DEFAULT which has different values to keep the aliens alive longer; expect more incursions, even when you are destroying the alien dimension! The end game is no longer easy and X-COM will have to fight in two places as well as avoid UFOs when navigating the alien dimension instead of attempting to butcher them...

[Change]	Agent Equipment Code re-ordered and restructured into a more alphabetised form with clips beneath the related weapon

[Change]	Human Tech Levels altered drastically to allow for more human enemy damage from a variety of new and old weapons. Expect to see nearly all of the EWM weapons in use at least once in the list, if only for one tech level.

[Change]	Average number of guards doubled for all organisations except Aliens, X-COM and Civilian.

[Change]	[Economy] Remove duplicated items that are in base gamestate (unless part of a tree modified by the mod)
