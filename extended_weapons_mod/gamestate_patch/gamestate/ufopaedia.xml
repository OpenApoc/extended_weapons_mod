						<title>Brainsucker Pod</title>
						<description>The pod has a hard and extremely tough skin, this peels back in the presence of human beings. A creature popularly referred to as a Brainsucker then emerges fully formed and active. Our conclusion is that these pods are a genetically engineered device designed to attack only human life forms.</description>

						<title>Micronoid Aggregate</title>
						<description>The capture of a Micronoid Aggregate is an essential step in the advancement of our knowledge. This formless mass of micro-organisms is found inside the bloodstream of other Alien forms. Each microscopic organism is an independent and intelligent life form. They communicate with each other using Psionic projection, but they are unresponsive to human Psionics. It is unclear whether these creatures are parasites or an integral part of the Alien spawn.</description>

						<description>This is not one single creature but billions of micro-organisms. These organisms have been found in the cardiovascular systems of other Aliens, but until now we were unaware of their extraordinary capability to act independently. It is clear that our research must concentrate on these unusual life forms.</description>

						<title>Popper</title>
						<description>The Popper runs at high speed towards its victim and explodes when within a range of about fifteen feet. There appears to be more than one sub-species of this creature, each containing a slightly different mix of chemicals for different effects as the creature detonates. If the Popper is attacked with armor piercing, incendiary or explosive ammunition then the explosive effect is likely to be triggered. We recommend that other forms of weaponry be used against this creature in most combat situations.</description>

						<description>The Popper is little more than a walking bomb. Its simple brain structure means that Psionic attacks have a very low chance of success. Its body contains no obvious explosive device, although there are several chemicals mixed into the creatures stomach creating a highly unstable explosive compound. There appears to be more than one sub-species of this creature, each containing a slightly different mix of chemicals for different effects as the creature detonates.</description>

			<description>X-COM bases are constructed from a variety of component units designed to perform different functions. The construction of a new base requires a bare minimum of living quarters and storage facilities. Beyond these requirements a base is designed to accommodate research, training and vehicle repair facilities. Bases will also need to be defended against aggression using well equipped Agents and security stations.</description>

						<description>A powerful, biological, gas grenade developed by the aliens in the form of a thin-skinned pod that can be thrown, rupturing and releasing thick noxious gasses on detonation. Like the Alien Boomeroid it has some capacity to "jump" towards the intended target. The device initially creates a Psionic disruption blast, then the gasses emitted will drain Psi-energy, causing a variety of responses and possibly even render the target unconscious. We cannot replicate this organism in the lab and we must turn to our own weapons manufacturers in the city to offer an alternative.</description>

The range of available ammunition has been updated to make use of materials discovered since the war and has seen miniaturisation to large composite darts from the original, rather basic, Steel Harpoons. The darts are contained within sealed packs of 10. Each dart has its own gas reservoir and may contain a variety of biological/chemical/explosive agents that are released on striking a target.</description>

						<description>The Gauss Pistol uses electromagnetically accelerated projectile technology developed during The Second Alien War. It is different from the original Gauss Weapons of that era that focussed on particle acceleration only in that it launches a solid bolt at the target with the great speeds attainable from magnetic field acceleration. It is fast, accurate and functions above and below water. These weapons were manufactured in abundance throughout the 2050s and we have identified a supplier of surplus units from that troubled period. The pistol only carries one acceleration rail providing a single-round burst.</description>

						<description>A powerful, but short-ranged, weapon developed by MarSec for clearing the remains of the Cydonian Base during the years following The First Alien War. It is typically used with specialist IN fuel, though the capability for using a variety of other chemical and biological agents exists. It has seen limited, illegal, use by MarSec for crowd dispersion in the colonies and by a myriad of powerful gangs over the decades of it's manufacture.</description>

It is advised that all X-COM squads practice a loose squad cohesion when faced with this weapon and communicate via their radios. Tight formations will undoubtedly lead to tragedy and the disciplining of any squad leader who survives.</description>
