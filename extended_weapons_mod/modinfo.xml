  <version>V9.0J (INTERNAL)</version>
  <description>**See Changelog.txt for History**
  
  Some time ago, voiddweller created a mod that added in several new weapons from UFO/TFTD as well as bought the Cultist and Gang armours from the regular game to the market screen.

Since then, FilmBoy84 has been adding even more new content as well as crushing bugs and balancing. This is very much a WIP.</description>
